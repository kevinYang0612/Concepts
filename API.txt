API: application programming interface. 
A set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to create software
or interact with an external system.
It is like a contract, a contract between the data provider and the developer. These are all the things 
that developers can access, and these are the methods, objects, the protocols you would use to access.
We, the developers, as the website hosts the data, will try to not change any of these methods or function
without notifying you.

Your server request through APIs on someone else's server. Someone else's server will response. 

Analogy: you go to a restaurant, the menu is what they sell, if you go to the kitchen, 
you see ingredients. You can't eat ingredients, you only can eat what is on the menu. 
The stuff in the kitchen is off-limits. 

Like weather API, you get to access temperature, weather condition, weather image, and etc

Example: Yahoo main page has weather forcast. It is not Yahoo's job to collect weather data. 
They could use a weather data service, all they need to do is to use their API to tap into that
live weather data, they are able to pull data into website.


Endpoint: every API that interacts with a external system like a server, will have an endpoint
For example, kanye.rest API endpoint is a URL "https://api.kanye.rest". They will always tell you
what it is in documentation. 

Path and parameter can use in order to narrow down on a specific piece of data you want from an external server.

Paths: Like joke API allow you to access a database of random jokes and through the use of path and parameters
we are going to customize the kind of jokes we want to get back. 
such as "https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/joke/Programming" is the path to get a joke of programming
The endpoint is "https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/joke/", "Programming" is the path. 

Parameters: order of parameter does not matter, they are key=value pair, q=paris&units=metric
"https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/joke/Programming?contains=debugging" where after ? is the parameter
if you have more than one parameter, you separate with an ampersand &
If I search a joke contain specific string of joke, we need parameter, 
such as I search a joke containing string: debugging. this is the parameter

Authentication: Every user uses a API, needs a key to keep track of your uses. 
Everytime you make a request through the API, they have to be able to identify you as the developer
and they keep track of how often you are using their server to get data, and then charge you or limit you.
